# KernelSU Style UI Kit

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

## Introduction

KernelSU Style UI Kit is an Android UI template project extracted and reorganized from the visual style of KernelSU Manager.

The project keeps the original Miuix and Material interface styles while removing practical KernelSU functionality such as root access, module management, flashing, and superuser authorization. It is intended as a reusable UI starter template for Android open-source apps, allowing developers to replace the business logic, update branding, and continue building on top of it.

Currently retained practical features include:

- Update checking
- Log sharing
- Automatic language switching
- Miuix / Material theme switching

## Usage

1. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chenaizhang/aqzlgj-kotlin.git
cd aqzlgj-kotlin
```

2. Open the project with Android Studio and wait for Gradle sync to finish.

3. Update the basic app information for your own project:

- `applicationId`, `namespace`, and version information in `app/build.gradle.kts`
- App name and text resources in `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`
- Icon assets in `app/src/main/res/drawable` and `app/src/main/res/mipmap-*`
- Update-check URL and About page links

4. Build the debug APK:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

5. For release builds, create your own signing configuration based on `sign.example.properties` and fill in real keystore information. Do not commit real signing files or passwords to the repository.
